# zoom_camp_Project

# Introduction
This project aims to develop a cancer predictions model using machine learning techniques. The model is built with Flask for the web application, Docker for containerization, and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management. Additionally, MLflow Registry is used for managing model versions, and the deployment is handled via Azure Container Instances, ensuring scalability and ease of use.

# Technologies Used

* Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers.
* Flask: A micro web framework for Python, used to build web applications quickly and with minimal code.
* MLflow: An open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
* scikit-learn: A popular Python library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
* Parameter Tuning: The process of optimizing hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance.
* MLflow Registry: A centralized model store that enables you to manage the full lifecycle of MLflow models, including versioning, staging, and production.
* Pytest: A robust testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.
* Azure Container Instances: A service that allows you to run Docker containers on Azure without managing the underlying infrastructure.
* GitHub Actions: A CI/CD platform that enables you to automate your software workflows directly in your GitHub repository.
